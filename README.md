motor control system using analog integrated circuits (ICs) that can control the speed and direction of a DC motor (typically used in electric vehicles).

INTRODUCTION

The control of DC motors is a fundamental aspect of robotics and automation systems. This project demonstrates how to control the speed and direction of a DC motor using an L298N motor driver module and an Arduino UNO microcontroller.


OBJECTIVES

•	To control the direction of a DC motor using the L298N motor driver.
•	To regulate the speed of the motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals from the Arduino UNO.
•	To understand motor driver functionality and Arduino programming.


COMPONENTS REQUIRED

Hardware Components:
o	Arduino UNO – Microcontroller board for generating control signals.
o	L298N Motor Driver – Dual H-Bridge motor driver module.
o	DC Motor – 12V DC motor.
o	Power Supply – 12V for motor and 5V for Arduino UNO.
o	Jumper Wires – For connections.
o	Breadboard – For testing connections.
Software:
o	Arduino IDE for programming and uploading code.
